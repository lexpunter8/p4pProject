4. ADDITIONAL TERMS FOR BUSINESSES

THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSION APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW IN YOUR JURISDICTION. Nothing in this Licence limits Piriform's liability to you in the event of death or personal injury resulting from our negligence or for fraud. The provisions of this section 6 shall survive the termination of this Licence howsoever caused.

7. LAW AND JURISDICTION
